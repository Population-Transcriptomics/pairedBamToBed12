*pairedBamToBed12*
###############

``pairedBamToBed12`` converts *properly paired* BAM alignments to
BED12 format.  Typical *proper pairs* will be represented by a 2 blocks BED12
entry.  Additional blocks are produced when an alignment contains long deletion
(CIGAR N-op).  Thickness indicates the first read of the pair.  The BAM input
file must be grouped/sorted by query name (not alignment position). 

==========================================================================
Installation
==========================================================================

Type `make` and a ``pairedBamToBed12`` executable file will appear the ``bin``
directory.  Test it with `make test`.

Usage and option summary
==========================================================================
**Usage**:
::

    pairedBamToBed12 [OPTIONS] -i <BAM>



.. tabularcolumns:: |p{4.5cm}|p{8.5cm}|

=============   ================================================================
Option          Description
=============   ================================================================
**-dblock**     Triggers the creation of a new block when an alignment contains
                short deletion from reference (CIGAR D-op).
**-color**      An R,G,B string for the color used with BED12 format. Default 
                is (255,0,0).
**-qual**       The minimum (inclusive) mapQ sum for reporting
                the paired BAM into a BED12. Default is 0.
**-x**          Optional filename where unprocessed mapped pairs can be stored.
=============   ================================================================


==========================================================================
Default behavior
==========================================================================
By default it processes a *properly paired* pair of reads into a single BED12
line, where the start and end positions are the 5′ end of Read 1 and the 3′ end
of Read 2.  The BED12 blocks are used to indicate positions where the reads
match, and the thick part indicates where is the contribution of Read 1.  The
relative orientation of the mate pairs must be forward/reverse (which is the
standard in most libraries prepared for the Illumina platform). 

.. note::
    
    The BAM file must be sorted by read name.

.. note::
    Reads that are not followed by their mate or not properly paired will be skipped.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pairedBamToBed12 -i 1proper-pair.bam 
  chr1	50053297	50053480	M00528:19:000000000-A88YD:1:1101:2241:12366	0	+	50053297	50053324	255,0,0	2	27,21	0,162

==========================================================================
Usage with transcriptome libraries
==========================================================================

In transcriptome analysis, the BED12 entries produced by ``pairedBamToBed12``
represent the minimal information about a cDNA that was given by a read pair.

``pairedBamToBed12`` was created for the analysis of CAGEscan_ libraries, which
are paired-end directional libraries of random-primed 5′ cDNAs.  The BED12
files are used to assemble *CAGEscan clusters* that combine all the pairs where
the 5′ end is in the same transcript start site peak, thus providing approximate
rudimentary transcript models for each peak.  A typical analysis can be found in
`Kratz et al., 2014`_.

This BED12 format is also supported in RIKEN's Zenbu_ genome browser, where one
can load data in this format and visualise it either as genome intervals or as
expression histograms.
    
.. NOTE::
    BWA has a bug that will set the *properly paired* flag for reads where one
    mate is aligned very near the end of a chromosome and the other is aligned
    very near the beginning of the next chromosome, when the ``-a`` option of
    ``sampe`` is large.  However, for CAGEscan, large numbers are necessary to
    span whole gene loci.   It is therefore recommended to sanitise the output
    of BWA with SAMtools, using its ``fixmate`` command, that corrects the
    *properly paired* flag since version 1.0.

Advantages and limitations in comparison with ``bedtools bamtobed``
==========================================================================

The advantage compared to ``bedtools bamtobed -split`` is that ``pairedBamToBed12``
reports the whole pair on a single line, and the advantage compared with
``bedtools bamtobed -bedpe``, is that it reports spliced alignments.

The limitation of ``pairedbamtobed12`` is that it only pertains to pairs mapped
on the same chromosome and is therefore unfit for representing gene fusions or
interchromosomal interactions.
